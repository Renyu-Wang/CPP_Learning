\page demapper_mimo Simulation of SISO demappers using ST codes in ideal MIMO channels

This program shows the usage of Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) demappers with 
Space Time (ST) codes in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels.
The ST codes are generated using the STC class, the MIMO channels are ideal
(no multi-antenna interferrence and no noise) and the receiver 
is implemented by the demapper method of the SISO class.
