    Bugs:
    Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler. 
        Some common syntax errors are: 
            Missing semicolon ;
            Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }
        Some common type errors are:
            Forgetting to declare a variable
            Storing a value into the wrong type
    Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
        Some common link-time errors:
            Using a function that was never defined (more on this later) 
            Writing Main() instead of main()
    Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.
        Some common run-time errors:
            Division by zero also known as division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler 
                doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs. (Floating point exception (core dumped))
            Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist
    Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
        Some common logic errors:
            Program logic is flawed
            Some “silly” mistake in an if statement or a for/while loop
